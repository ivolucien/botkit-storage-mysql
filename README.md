# botkit-storage-mysql

A MySQL storage module for Botkit.

## Usage

Just require `botkit-storage-mysql` and pass it a config with a `host` option.
Then pass the returned storage when creating your Botkit controller. Botkit will do the rest.
The `host` is the only required parameter in the configuration, but the configuration is passed through to `node-mysql`.
Anything that [node-mysql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) supports can be used.

Make sure everything you store has an `id` property, that's what you'll use to look it up later.

```
var Botkit = require('botkit'),
    var mysqlStorage = require('botkit-storage-mysql')({host: '127.0.0.1', user: 'root', password: 'rootPassword', database: 'my_db_name'});,
    controller = Botkit.slackbot({
        storage: mysqlStorage
    });
```
### Setup Tables

Either manually run the contents of `createTables.sql` or call `setupTables()`

There is no table prefix by default, but `setupTables()` must be called with the prefix string if a table prefix is used.

```
Botkit.setupTables({ tablePrefix: 'groot_', createIfNotExists: true }, callback(err) {
  // creates `groot_botkit_*` tables
}
```
